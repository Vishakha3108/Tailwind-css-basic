                about his tendency to be rough on people. "Look at the result," he replied. "These are all smart people
                I Work with, and any of them could get a top job at another place if they were truly feeling brutalied. But 
                they don't." Then he paused for a few moments and said, almost wishfully, "And we got some amazing things done."
                Indeed, he and Apple had had a string of hits over the past dozen years that was greater then that of any other
                innovation company in modern times: iMac, iPad, ipod, nano, iTunes Store, Apple Stores, MacBook, iPhone, iPad
                App Store, OS X Lion--not to mention every Pixar film. And as he battled his final illness, Jobs was surrounded by 
                an intensely loyal cadre of collegues who had been inspired by him for years and a very loving wife,sister,and 
                four children.
